01_General_Return_Policy_Overview.txt,0,"General Return Policy Overview At ReturnMind Inc., we strive to provide a stress-free shopping experience by offering a customer-friendly return policy. We understand that sometimes purchases dont work out, and we want to make sure the return process is as simple and fair as possible. Our general return policy allows customers to return most products within 30 days of the delivery date. To be eligible, items must be unused, in their original condition, and include all original packaging, manuals, tags, and accessories. If your product is defective or damaged during shipping, please notify us within 48 hours for a free return. We do not charge restocking fees for most items. However, high-value electronics or large appliances may incur a 10% restocking fee if returned due to buyers remorse. In cases of defective items, ReturnMind will cover the return shipping cost and waive any fees. You can initiate a return by logging into your ReturnMind account, selecting the order, and clicking Request Return. Well provide a prepaid return label and instructions. After we receive and inspect the item, your refund will be processed within 57 business days to the original payment method. If you paid using store credit or gift cards, the amount will be returned to your ReturnMind wallet. Returns that do not meet our criteria may be rejected or issued a partial refund. We encourage customers to retain the original shipping box and receipt for a smoother return experience. Products received as gifts can be returned for store credit. ReturnMind reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Please refer to your specific product page or invoice for any item-specific return conditions. If you need help at any point, visit our Help Center or contact support@returnmind.com. Our support agents are here to assist you Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 6 PM EST."
