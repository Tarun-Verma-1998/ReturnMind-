### Exchanges vs Refunds

At ReturnMind Inc., we offer both exchanges and refunds to accommodate your needs:

**When to Choose an Exchange**:
- You ordered the wrong size or color
- The product arrived damaged and you want a replacement
- You're upgrading to a similar item (e.g., exchanging a tablet for a higher-storage model)

**When to Choose a Refund**:
- You no longer want the item
- You're switching to a different product entirely
- You want your funds returned to the original payment method

**Exchange Process**:
1. Initiate the return as usual.
2. Select “Exchange” and choose your preferred replacement.
3. Once your original item is received and inspected, the new item is shipped within 48 hours.

**Refund Process**:
1. Initiate return and select “Refund.”
2. After inspection, your payment is returned using the original method.

Note: Exchanges are subject to inventory availability. If your requested item is unavailable, you’ll automatically receive a refund.
