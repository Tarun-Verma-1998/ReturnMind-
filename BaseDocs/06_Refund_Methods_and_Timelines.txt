### Refund Methods and Timelines

ReturnMind Inc. strives to make your refund experience as smooth and transparent as possible. Here’s how it works:

**Refund Methods**:
- **Original Payment Method**: Refund is issued to the credit/debit card, PayPal, or digital wallet used during checkout.
- **Store Credit**: On request, refunds can be issued as store credit for future purchases.
- **Gift Returns**: Refunded as store credit when the original payment info is unavailable.

**Timelines**:
- **Inspection Period**: Once your returned item reaches our warehouse, we take 1–2 business days to inspect it.
- **Processing Time**: Approved returns are refunded within 5–7 business days.
- **Bank Processing Delays**: Your financial institution may require 2–3 additional days to reflect the refund.

You’ll be notified by email at each step — when the return is received, inspected, and refunded. For exchanges, your replacement product will ship after the return passes inspection.

If the refund is not reflected after 10 days, contact support with your order ID and tracking number.
