### Condition Requirements for Returned Items

To ensure that returns are accepted, ReturnMind Inc. requires items to meet specific condition standards. These vary slightly depending on product type but generally include:

- **Unused State**: Items should not show any signs of use. Clothing should not be worn or washed. Electronics must not have been powered on beyond initial testing.
- **Damage-Free**: No scratches, dents, chips, stains, or other physical damage.
- **Cleanliness**: Products must be free from dirt, hair, odors, or other contaminants.
- **Packaging**: Original boxes, wraps, barcodes, tags, and stickers must be present.
- **Completeness**: All included items (manuals, screws, remotes, adapters) must be returned.

Returned products go through a quality inspection. If an item does not meet these standards, you may receive a partial refund or have your return denied.

Here are a few examples:
- A shoe returned without its original box may result in a 10% deduction.
- A used blender with residue inside will be returned to sender.
- Missing cables or parts will result in partial refunds.

We recommend taking pictures of your return package before shipping it back. This helps in case of transit disputes.
