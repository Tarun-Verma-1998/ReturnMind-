### Eligibility Criteria for Returns

ReturnMind Inc. values transparency and fairness. That’s why we’ve clearly outlined our eligibility criteria for returns. Before initiating a return, make sure your item meets the following conditions:

- **Return Window**: The item must be returned within 30 days of delivery. Certain categories like apparel and books may have extended windows (up to 45 days), while perishables are not eligible at all.
- **Product Condition**: The item must be unused, unwashed, and in resalable condition. Electronics must have no signs of physical damage or liquid exposure. Apparel should still have original tags.
- **Original Packaging**: All returns must be sent back with the original manufacturer’s packaging. This includes boxes, plastic wraps, protective foam, and tamper seals.
- **Accessories and Manuals**: Items such as chargers, adapters, user manuals, and warranty cards must be returned intact.
- **Proof of Purchase**: A valid receipt, order confirmation, or invoice must be included with your return package.

Items returned that do not meet these criteria may be rejected or subject to a partial refund depending on the condition of the product.

For example:
- A phone returned without its charger may receive only 80% of the original refund value.
- Used items, like a blender with food residue, will be rejected unless defective.

Exceptions may apply for items that arrived damaged or incorrect. If that's the case, contact us within 48 hours to avoid disqualification.

Please double-check your product’s eligibility before initiating the return to ensure a quick and smooth process.
