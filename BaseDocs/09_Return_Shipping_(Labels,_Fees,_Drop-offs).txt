### Return Shipping (Labels, Fees, Drop-offs)

We aim to make return shipping simple:

- **Prepaid Return Labels**: Provided for most standard returns. Download from your order page and print.
- **Drop-off Locations**: ReturnMind has partnered with UPS, FedEx, and Canada Post. Use your return label at any of these drop-off points.
- **Pick-Up Option**: Available in major metro areas for bulky items. Schedule via our support team.

**Return Fees**:
- **Free**: If your item is defective, incorrect, or damaged.
- **Flat Fee ($5)**: For buyerâ€™s remorse returns in most categories.
- **Customer Paid**: For international returns or some final sale items.

Always repackage the product securely. Use original packing where possible and include the return form to ensure smooth processing.
